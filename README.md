# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**Project Flow:**
The App component holds the state for the input field, the list of tasks, and the task being edited.
The Form component manages the form for adding or editing tasks. It receives input and state via props from the App component.
The TodoList component displays the list of tasks, and it includes functionality to complete, edit, and delete tasks. It also receives state and functions from the App component.
The Header component displays a simple header.

**App.js**
This is the main component that brings together the other components (Header, Form, and TodoList). It manages the state for the input, the list of tasks, and the task being edited. It also handles the logic for updating and adding tasks.

**Form.js**
This component represents the form for adding or editing tasks. It uses the uuid library to generate unique IDs for each task. The useEffect hook is used to update the input field when editing a task. The onInputChange function handles changes in the input field, and onFormSubmit is triggered when the form is submitted, either to add a new task or update an existing one.

**TodoList.js**
This component displays the list of tasks. It includes functionality to mark tasks as complete, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks. The handleComplete, handleEdit, and handleDelete functions are responsible for these actions.

**Header.js**
This is a simple header component that displays the title of your task management application.

Tasks are stored in the state (todos) of the App component.
Form component manages the input field for adding or editing tasks.
TodoList component displays the list of tasks and includes actions to mark tasks as complete, edit tasks, and delete tasks.
